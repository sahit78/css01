<div color:pink><h1> ANIME</h1></div>
<p>Anime is a Japanese style of animation that is featured in many popular TV programs and films. 
<br>
The contemporary anime style originated in the 1960s in Japan when artists who drew manga-distinctly Japanese comics-began to translate their work into animation for TV and film.
<br>
 This new style became immensely popular in Japan, and by the 1980s, the popularity of anime had begun to spread to other countries. By the beginning of this century, anime was one of the most popular styles of animation worldwide.

    <h1>History of Anime</h1>
</div>  
        <p4>The history of anime dates back to the early 20th century, with the earliest verifiable films emerging in 1917.
<br>
 Before film, Japan had rich traditions of storytelling through emakimono (scrolls with illustrated stories) and kagee (shadow plays). <br>
These precursors influenced the birth of Japanese animation, which has since evolved into a global phenomenon! ðŸŽ¥ðŸŒŸ</p4>
